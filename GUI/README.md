# AlbertaLoop GUI [work in progress]
The pod UI is written in PyQt, which allows for easy hierarchical and modular organization. This is just a front-end representation of the interface, built using **Qt Creator**. The signals and actions need to be coded by hand moving forward, to allow the button presses to work, and further actions to take place.
